# Lesson 01

Date: September 26, 2022

## Warm Up

Warm up by playing four consecutive notes on each string starting with the low-e string. Once you have played this sequence on each string, move up a fret and play four notes in the reverse order and from the high-e string down. 

Ex: 

`1,2,3,4` up the strings, `5,4,3,2` down, `3,4,5,6` back up, etc. Continue this partern until you finish `9,10,11,12` up the strings.
